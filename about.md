> "I know more today than I did yesterday. That's my mindset of programming now."

I'm a junior RoR developer, aiming a decent web developer(focusing on Back-End) now.
I always try to learn new tech with joy :)
I write about code(usually Ruby, Rails, and Hanamirb), reviews, and some thoughts in my mind.

Main Interests

- Ruby (NOT JUST RAILS)
- Whole Javascript things (from Node.js to ReactJS, AngularJS and so on); Totally not good at it. but trying to be better.
- How can I become a true developer?
